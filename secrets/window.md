Secret Windows refers to hidden features, settings, and modes in the Windows operating system that are not easily discoverable but can provide additional functionality and customization options to users. These hidden features can enhance user experience, improve productivity, and offer unique capabilities. Here are some examples of secret Windows features:

Dark Mode: Windows 10 and Windows 11 offer a built-in Dark mode that changes the theme of the operating system to a dark color scheme. This not only looks visually appealing but can also reduce eye strain, save battery life, and improve visibility in low-light environments [7] [9].
Snap Assist: This feature allows users to easily arrange windows on the screen by dragging them to the sides or corners. It helps in multitasking and comparing multiple documents or programs simultaneously [8].
Virtual Desktops: Virtual Desktops enable users to create multiple desktop environments, allowing for better organization and a clutter-free workspace. It can be particularly useful for users who work with many open programs or windows [8].
Cortana: Cortana is a digital assistant in Windows that can perform various tasks, such as setting reminders, sending emails, and finding information online. It can be accessed through the Windows search bar and can help users with everyday tasks [8].
DNS Over HTTPS: DNS Over HTTPS is a hidden setting in Windows 11 that encrypts DNS queries made by your PC, improving privacy and security. It ensures that all communication on your Windows 11 PC, including browsers, apps, and services, is protected and private [12].
These are just a few examples of the many secret Windows features available. Exploring these hidden features can provide users with additional functionality and customization options, enhancing their overall Windows experience.
